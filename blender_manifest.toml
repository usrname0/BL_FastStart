# (named by 'id', e.g., 'blender_faststart/') contains an __init__.py 
# that Blender uses as the entry point for registration.
# If your __init__.py in the 'blender_faststart/' folder correctly imports 
# register/unregister from extension_logic.py, this should be fine.

# No changes needed for wheels, as you're vendoring pure Python libs.
