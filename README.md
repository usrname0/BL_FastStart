# blender_faststart
This is an extension for Blender 4.4+. 

Blender_faststart puts a checkbox on your output panel to add a 'Fast Start' copy of MP4/MOV renders. It will create an extra MP4/MOV file with the suffix '-faststart' (your normal render is untouched).

Credit to https://github.com/danielgtaylor/qtfaststart for the part of this extension that actually does all the work.

 # Status
 This is currently working in Windows 11 and should theoretically work everywhere but that is untested.  I will be adding some documentation shortly.
